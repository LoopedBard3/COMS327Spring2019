This program meets the requirements of assignment 1.02. This means that it can load and save dungeons, in the specified data locations and in big endian, from and to the $HOME/.rlg327/dungeon file.

To use this program, first run make in the folder with the program. This should generate a few files including rlg327.
Then for usage:
./rlg327 [ <seed integer> | --load | --save ]

You can specify multiple of these arguments, but if you load and seed at the same time, the seed will be ignored.
