This program meets the specifications for assignment 1.05. This includes using ncurses to render the screen, allowing the player to control the PC, and the ability to use all of the specified key commands. I also added the ability to use Q in the monster menu to close it if you don't want to use escape. 

The display of the dungeon matches the specification of having the dungeon between the 1-21 lines leaving the top line for messages to the player and for displaying the most recent combat results.

Usage: ./rlg327 [-r|--rand <seed>] [-l|--load [<file>]]
        [-s|--save [<file>]] [-i|--image <pgm file>]
        [-n|--nummon <number of monsters min:1>]
