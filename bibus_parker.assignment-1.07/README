This program meets the specifications for assignment 1.07. This includes parsing and printing out each valid monster in the monster definition file. This also includes adding checks to make sure the file opened, the header is valid, and that each monster added to the definition list is valid. If any errors occur while parsing the monsters that monster is discarded and the next one is parsed. 

In order to run the program and have it print the parse data you must run it with the -p flag found in usage.

Usage: ./rlg327 [-r|--rand <seed>] [-l|--load [<file>]]
        [-s|--save [<file>]] [-i|--image <pgm file>]
        [-n|--nummon <number of monsters min:1>] [-p|--parser parser output only]
