This program meets the specifications for assignment 1.04. This includes spawning the specified or default number of monsters, having monsters follow their movement characteristics, and having a turn based event system that uses the speed of characters to determine their turns. This program demonstrates these requirements by providing a --nummon <int> switch, printing out the dungeon every player turn, having unique moving monsters, displaying entities based on their traits, and having the turns of entities being based on their speed.  

One note is that the number of monsters defaults to the number of spawn spaces if there isn't enough space for the specified number to spawn.

Also, trait bits can be found enumerated under monster_trait in dungeon.h.

Usage: ./rlg327 [-r|--rand <seed>] [-l|--load [<file>]]
        [-s|--save [<file>]] [-i|--image <pgm file>]
        [-n|--nummon <number of monsters min:1>]
