This program meets the specifications for assignment 1.04. This includes spawning the specified or default number of monsters, having monsters follow their movement characteristics, and having a turn based event system that uses the speed of characters to determine their turns. This program demonstrates these requirements by providing a --nummon <int> switch, printing out the dungeon every player turn, having unique moving monsters, and having the turns of entities being based on their speed.
